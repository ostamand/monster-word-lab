Help me design another page of my website. The landing page is provided as a reference. When a user clicks on Start a new experiment, he gets redirected to a new page where he need to choose: - a language (english, french or spanish) - an age (3,4,5,6,7), an optional theme (one word) and an optional target word (one word). 

Additionnaly, there should be a button (matching the style of the landing page) to start the experiement.  

This page again needs to include the character (Professor Lex) added as a reference image also (professor-lex-sheet.png) but in a different setting, environment and action. 

Finally, for even more context here is some details on the website I am building:

## Project Summary: Monster Word Lab

**Monster Word Lab** is an interactive, AI-powered literacy platform designed to transform how children aged **4–7** learn to read. By combining personalized storytelling with a whimsical "laboratory" theme, the app creates a high-engagement environment where kids can "engineer" their own learning materials.

### **Core Functionality**

The platform empowers parents and children to generate custom educational assets on demand:

* **Custom Inputs:** Users provide an **age**, an **optional theme** (e.g., space, dinosaurs), and a **specific keyword** to focus on.
* **Unique Asset Generation:** The system produces a unique visual scene, a tailored learning sentence, and high-quality **text-to-speech** (TTS) narration.
* **Experiment Paths:** The landing page offers two distinct journeys:
* **Start New Experiment:** Generate a fresh, personalized reading asset.
* **Explore Previous Experiments:** Review past creations or assets generated by the community.

### **The Mascot: Professor Lex**

To provide a friendly, consistent face for the brand, the "Lab" is run by **Professor Lex**, a mentor designed specifically for early childhood appeal.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Visual Style** | High-end 3D cinematic rendering (Pixar-inspired). |
| **Appearance** | A tall, shaggy monster with vibrant **violet fur** and large, expressive eyes. |
| **Key Accessories** | Oversized round black spectacles and a crisp white lab coat. |
| **Personality** | Energetic, brilliant, and slightly clumsy; he acts as a safe, encouraging guide. |
| **Multilingual Design** | Assets featuring Lex (like his books) use abstract icons and glow effects instead of text to remain compatible with any language. |

### **Design Philosophy**

> **"Learning through Discovery"**
> The app avoids a traditional classroom feel. Instead, it frames literacy as a scientific discovery process, using "magical" 3D visuals and tactile textures (like Lex’s soft fur) to make the digital experience feel warm and approachable for young learners.
